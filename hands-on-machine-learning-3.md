## Hands-On Machine Learning

The SDML book club started discussing *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 3rd Edition* 
by Aurelien Geron in August 2025. 
Note that there are 3 editions of this book, and the 2nd and 3rd editions have very similar covers,
with the edition number shown in the upper right corner.
This is a popular book and can be purchased from most stores where you buy technical books.
Note also, we have learned that a [new edition of the book is being written which will use 
PyTorch](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9798341607972/) instead of TensorFlow in Part II of the book.
We will also pull in available resources from the new edition to cover PyTorch.

This is an extraordinarily well written book, and people who do the work every week can "go from zero to hero" in just a few months.
The plan will be to do one chapter weekly, except one Saturday each month will be reserved for discussing computer vision and ML news.

### Notes and videos
Below are the notes/slides and meetup recordings. 
All of the videos will be posted to the SDML YouTube channel:  [https://www.youtube.com/@SanDiegoMachineLearning/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@SanDiegoMachineLearning/videos)
