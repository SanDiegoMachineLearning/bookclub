## Quantum Computing

The SDML book club started discussing *Dancing with Qubits* by Robert Sutor (https://www.packtpub.com/product/dancing-with-qubits/9781838827366) in August 2022. 

### Notes and videos
Below are the schedule, any additional materials, and links to the meetup recordings.  The videos will all be uploaded to Ryan's YouTube channel:  https://www.youtube.com/c/ITConnected/videos.

#### Part I -- Foundations

Chapter 1:  **Why Quantum Computing?** \
Here is the full [Meetup event description](https://www.meetup.com/san-diego-machine-learning/events/287313636/) for the kickoff on August 13. 
We will meet each other in small breakout rooms and discuss chapter 1 of the book. \
Here is the [session schedule and outline of chapter 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ckVprsqS7mXo9Q_4nBs6EBCIbNW30BUMu-r0Ix1c34s/edit?usp=sharing)
and the [video recording of the kickoff](https://youtu.be/xNM3zxHsxVE).

Chapter 2:  **They’re Not Old, They’re Classics** \
The [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/san-diego-machine-learning/events/287822260/) on Saturday, August 20.
We set a baseline for what classical computing is and how algorithms scale, so that we can show differences with quantum computing. \
