## Reinforcement Learning

The SDML book club started discussing *Reinforcement Learning:  An Introduction (second edition)* 
by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto in May 2021. 
A PDF copy of the book and other related material can be found on Richard Sutton's [book website](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html).

### Notes and videos
Below are the notes/slides and meetup recordings:

Session 1:  **Introduction to Reinforcement Learning** \
Here is the full [Meetup event description](https://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Machine-Learning/events/277882829/). 
Most of the material was drawn from chapters 1 and 3 of the Sutton & Barto book. 
Content was covered over two weeks. \
Slides are available in [PowerPoint (large file)](https://github.com/tedkyi/reinforcement-learning/blob/main/1_Introduction_to_reinforcement_learning.pptx) 
or [PDF (smaller file)](https://github.com/tedkyi/reinforcement-learning/blob/main/1_Introduction_to_reinforcement_learning.pdf), 
and [Meetup video](https://youtu.be/jDdF8FRgju0) from the first week and [part two video](https://youtu.be/xeos7wa5y-k) are both up.

Session 2:  **Dynamic Programming and Monte Carlo Methods for RL** \
Here is the detailed [Meetup event description](https://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Machine-Learning/events/278318808/). 
The main material for this session came from chapters 4 and 5 of the Sutton & Barto book.
This session also was covered over two weeks. \
The first week discussed dynamic programming.  Here are the [slides](https://github.com/tedkyi/reinforcement-learning/blob/main/2a_Dynamic_programming.pdf),
and here is the [dynamic programming video](https://youtu.be/ac4wjMcvkv8). \
The second week discussed Monte Carlo methods in RL.  This is the link to the [slides in Ted's repo](https://github.com/tedkyi/reinforcement-learning/blob/main/2b_Monte_carlo_methods.pdf),
and this is the [Monte Carlo methods video](https://youtu.be/Fwk7F2cVuWQ).

Session 3:  **Temporal-Difference Learning** \
Here is the [Meetup event description](https://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Machine-Learning/events/278801444/).
The majority of the material for this session comes from chapter 6 of the Sutton & Barto book. \
Here are the [slides](https://github.com/tedkyi/reinforcement-learning/blob/main/3_Temporal_difference_learning.pdf) and video will be uploaded soon.

Session 4:  **Programming Reinforcement Learning Algorithms** \
Full details in the [Meetup event description](https://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Machine-Learning/events/278970571/).


### Python Implementation
An implementation of the examples in the book in Python has been shared in this repo: <https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction>.
I haven't had a chance to review it to validate all of the code runs without errors.
